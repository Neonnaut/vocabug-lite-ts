![Vocabug logo](./img/vocabug_logo.svg?raw=true "Vocabug-lite")

This is a word generator designed to be a successor to the Williams' [Lexifer][1] and to the legendary [Awkwords][2]. It is built using TypeScript and builds using Vite as a browser app with a complete interface. As the name implies, Vocabug-lite, is the 'lite' version of the full Vocabug, which is yet to be released.

Vocabug-lite randomly generates vocabulary from a given definition of graphemes, frequencies and word patterns. You can use it to make words for a constructed language, to get an original nickname or password, or just for fun.

## Development

To build use `npm run build`. For live testing use `npm run dev`.
